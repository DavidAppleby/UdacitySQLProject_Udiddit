This project is an exercise in understanding normalization, DDL language, proper indexing for query speed, and DDL/DQL for migrating data from a poorly designed database to the new database structure that is normalized.  Postgres is the database software used for the project.

Next, a series of queries against the new data structure have been written.

I have included the final report, the original script provided by Udacity to upload the poorly designed database into Postgres, and a script designed by me to create the new database structure, migrate the data to new structure, and the series of queries listed on the final report.
